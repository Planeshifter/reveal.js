					<h2>State of Things</h2>
					<p>
				    The sphere of politics has become blurry with the advent of social media and the blogosphere. In this complicated landscape, we wish to study how people get mobilized
				    for political action, how politicians try to reach out for their voters, how they portray themselves and their objectives.

<div style="font-size: 22px; text-align: justify; line-height: 25px;">Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) said Tuesday that President Obama has “committed impeachable offenses” and that the House could hold a hearing to impeach.

“We can have an impeachment hearing in the House, and in my mind the president has committed impeachable offenses,” Bachmann told conservative talk show host Rusty Humphries in an interview first detailed by Right Wing Watch.

Bachmann was careful to distinguish between the House’s ability to impeach the president, which she said would merely be a “stain” on his record, and the Senate’s authority to remove the president from office, which she acknowledged would be unlikely in the Democratic-controlled upper chamber.

Still, the Minnesota Republican warned that impeachment was a “disruptive and harmful” tool.

“Impeachment is important that we have that tool — it’s very important — but it’s also disruptive and harmful to the nation and it’s to be used sparingly,” she said.

But she argued it may be necessary because citizens are on the cusp of civil disobedience because they’re so fed up with Obama’s “thuggery.”

“I think we could be on the cusp of seeing civil disobedience — I’m not saying I want civil disobedience — but people aren’t going to take the thuggery of this president much longer,” she said. “We see thuggery going on in the White House, we’re not going to take it. We’ve drawn a line in the sand, and we’re telling the president you need to recognize ... that you are a co-equal branch of government. You are not a dictator.”

Bachmann said that the U.S. was at risk of devolving “into a dictatorship,” but that the Tea Party had done its job in standing up to Democrats on the fiscal issues surrounding the government shutdown.

“What this is about is whether or not we will hold on to a constitutional republic,” she said. “I want the Tea Party to know they made a profound difference and what they’re fighting for is to see if we’re actually going to be a constitutional republic or if we’re going to be totally devolved into a dictatorship under somebody like Barack Obama.”

					<h2>Collective Classification</h2>
					<ul>
					<li>Ordinary classification methods such as Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes predict the value for actor $Y_i$  using a feature vector $x_i$  containing the observed attributes of the observation</li>
					<li>In collective classification, one uses also information about actors in the neighbourhood of $Y_i$ in the prediction task</li>
					<li>Goal is then to infer the class labels with either the maximum joint probability or the maximum marginal probability for each node. </li>

						<h2> Classification Techniques: </h2>
						<ul>
						<li> <b> Iterative Classifier Approach: </b>
						<p>One at a time, generate the best classification for a single instance given all other parts of the problem (i.e. the
						correct labelling of the other instances)</p>
						</li>	
						<li><b>Gibbs Sampling:</b>	
						<p>Iteratively assign class labels to all nodes by drawing from the conditional distribution of the current node given the others. 
						After a sufficient number of iterations, count the number of times a given node was assigned a certain label and normalize to get probability
						estimates</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<b>Variational Methods:</b>
							<ul>
							<li>Loopy Belief Propagation Loopy</li> 
							<li>Mean-Field Relaxation Labeling (MF)</li>
							<li>Methods have in common that a trial distribution is chosen which is in some sense comparable to the true distribution (e.g. in terms of Kullback–Leibler divergence) 
								but much simpler to work with</li>
